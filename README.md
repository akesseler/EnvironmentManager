# EnvironmentManager

Mainly, this program is designed to switch Windows environment variables using the tray icon 
menu. But the program also allows to manage (creating, modifying and deleting) all environment 
variables.

Another feature of this program is the possibility to relaunch the program with administrator 
privileges as well as to install or remove auto-launch behavior on user logon.
